IOT Based Safety Gadget for Child Safety Monitoring & Notification 

Idea 1: 

An IoT device is proposed that can be wearable and connected with application. Parents  can create a Geo-fence from the child location. The IoT device contains GPS module so that  parents or guardians can continuously monitor child’s location. If they cross the Geo-fence the  notification will sent to parents or guardians.

• Able to create Geo-fence 
• Small and comfortable  
• Previously stored location will get updated when device cam the network coverage area Disadvantage: 
• If signal loss occur we can’t able to track the device. 
• The device was removeable, so child may remove the device 
• Charge may dispense

Idea 3: 

Abstract  

In this Project, we are going to prevent the child from the movement of the baby stroller.  Whenever the parent lets go of the stroller’s handlebar, the front wheel locks preventing it from  rolling away. Once the parent touches the handlebar, the lock on the front wheel disengages and  the stroller is free to move. To indicate the stroller is free to move, LED strips will be active 

Advantage  

• Ensures safety.
• Automatic braking system. 
• Preventing from Stoller. 

Disadvantage 

• Battery may finish  
• Chance of skiting 
• It may bulky due to heavy battery
